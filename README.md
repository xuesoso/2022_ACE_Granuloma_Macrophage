What is in each dataset:
------------------------

| datasets   |  descriptions |
| :---       |    :---   |
| sam_full.210505.h5ad | Processed 10X chromium v3.1 scRNA-seq data of splenocyte isolate. Contains samples collected from mouse infected by WT STm and dSTeE STm. Shown in Figure 1A-C. Shown in Figure S2A-B. |
| sam_full_velocyto.210505.h5ad | Contains same set of cells in "sam_full.210505.h5ad". Dataset is pre-processed with velocyto to yield RNA-velocity prediction. |
| sam_myeloidSubset.210505.h5ad | Myeloid sub-population derived from "sam_full.210505.h5ad". |
| sam_monocyteSubset.210505.h5ad | Monocyte macrophage sub-population derived from "sam_myeloidSubset.210505.h5ad". Shown in Figure 1D-G, Figure 2A-D, Figure S3A-C. |
| sam_monocyte_velocyto.210505.h5ad | Monocyte macrophage sub-population, same set of cells as in "sam_monocyteSubset.210505.h5ad". Dataset is pre-processed with velocyto to yield RNA-velocity prediction. Shown in Figure 2G. |
| sam_macrophageSubset_AB.210919.h5ad | Macrophage sub-population derived from "sam_monocyteSubset.210505.h5ad". Shown in Figure 3A-H. |
| harmony.sam_T_C_treatment.200119.sam_full.210505.h5ad | Processed 10X chromium v3.1 scRNA-seq data of splenocyte isolate. Contains samples collected from mouse treated with isotype control antibody or anti-TNFa antibody and then infected by WT STm. Data was aligned to "sam_full.210505.h5ad" using python implentation of harmony method (https://github.com/slowkow/harmonypy). |
| ABCT_SAM_momac.220828_review.h5ad | Derived from "sam_macrophageSubset_AB.210919.h5ad" and "harmony.sam_T_C_treatment.200119.sam_full.210505.h5ad". Contains samples collected from mouse infected by WT STm and dSTeE STm and from mouse treated with control antibody or anti-TNFa antibody. Both datasets have been subset to contain only the macrophage sub-population. "fig3_cell_type" and "fig3_leiden" have been updated to show cluster labels that are consistent with "sam_macrophageSubset_AB.210505.h5ad", which are the labels shown in Figure 6. "cell_type" and "leiden" reflect the original cluster labels generated by the analysis. |
| 201221_10X_velocyto_all.h5ad | This h5ad includes raw count values and velocyto estimate for all samples, including cells isolated from 4 x WT STm infected mice ("A"), 4 x dSTeE STm infected mice ("B"), 2 x isotype control antibody treated and WT STm infected mice ("C"), and 2 x anti-TNFa antibody treated and WT STm infected mice ("T"). |
